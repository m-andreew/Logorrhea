# Logorrhea
This chat server acts as a reference implementation for the Fred Short Message Protocol.
Also included is a simple client (WordFlow).

# Usage
Run `./certs`, then `python3 logorrhea.py` for the server or `wordflow.py` for the client.
The commands available to clients are:
* `/LOGON` to add yourself to the distribution list for messages
* `/LOGOFF` to remove yourself from the distribution of messages
* `/WHO` who is logged on currently?
* `/STATS` some chat server stats
* `message` whatever you want to tell your friends on the channel
